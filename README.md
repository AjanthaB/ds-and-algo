## Time Complexity of a Algorithm

Time complexity of a algorithm means, number of iterations need run to complete the algorithm
  Ex: O(n) - n number of iterations
  
  
## Stable Algorithm

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal or same keys appear in the same order
in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.

  original arry
  [A, B1, G, B2, C, E]
  
  after sort
  [A, B1, B2, C, E, G] order of the B1 and B2 will not changes if the algorithm is stable
